# Threat Modeling SaaS

## 🚀 Overview
Threat Modeling SaaS is a **security assessment platform** that helps developers, security engineers, and DevOps teams **identify and manage cybersecurity risks** in their applications. 

It leverages **OWASP Top 10** and **STRIDE threat modeling** methodologies to **automatically analyze system components** and provide actionable security recommendations.

---

## 🔥 Features
- **Create Threat Models** 🛠️  
  Add system components (APIs, databases, web apps) to assess security risks.
- **Automated Threat Detection** 🚨  
  Uses predefined security rules to **detect vulnerabilities**.
- **Fix Recommendations** 🔧  
  Provides **mitigation strategies** for detected threats.
- **PDF Reports** 📄  
  Export security findings and share them with your team.
- **API Integration** 🔗  
  Automate security checks within CI/CD pipelines.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
### **Backend**
- 🐍 **FastAPI** – High-performance Python API framework.
- 🛢️ **PostgreSQL** – For storing threat models and security data.
- 🔐 **JWT Authentication** – Secure user authentication.

### **Frontend**
- ⚛️ **React (Vite)** – Fast and modern UI framework.
- 🎨 **Bootstrap** – Provides responsive and clean UI components.

### **DevOps**

## 📦 Installation

### **1️⃣ Backend Setup**
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/threat-modeling-saas.git
cd threat-modeling-saas
```

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Start the FastAPI backend:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

### **2️⃣ Frontend Setup**
Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📜 Example API Request

### **Create a Threat Model**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/threat-models" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-d '{
    "name": "E-commerce API",
    "components": [
        {
            "name": "User Database",
            "type": "database",
            "sensitive_data": true,
            "encryption": false
        },
        {
            "name": "Public API Gateway",
            "type": "api",
            "exposed": true,
            "authentication": false
        }
    ]
}'
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "E-commerce API",
    "threats": [
        {
            "name": "SQL Injection",
            "risk_level": "High",
            "description": "Database lacks input validation.",
            "mitigation": "Use prepared statements."
        },
        {
            "name": "Broken Authentication",
            "risk_level": "Critical",
            "description": "Public API Gateway is exposed without authentication.",
            "mitigation": "Require authentication for API access."
        }
    ]
}
```

---

## 🌍 Deployment

### **Docker Setup**
You can run the entire application using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

For production, consider using **Kubernetes**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- 🔄 **Live collaboration** – Allow multiple users to edit threat models in real-time.
- 📊 **Risk scoring** – Automatically calculate security risk scores.
- 🛠️ **Custom threat rules** – Let users define custom security rules.
